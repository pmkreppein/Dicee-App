Dice Roll App

Made as part of a Udemy course published by the London App Brewery (https://www.udemy.com/ios11-app-development-bootcamp/).

Built this app to practice interacting with ImageViews, Random values, and device shake recognition.  The app simulates a psuedorandom dice roll by generating two random values and passing them as string parameters that corrospond with the respective dice face image asset.  You can push roll or shake your device to shuffle the dice.
